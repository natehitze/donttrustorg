## Don't ***Always*** Trust .org
### Why Not?

Anyone with $10 can register a `.org` website, including me: a random internet person. `.org` websites are not inherently more trustworthy than any other public top level domains (like `.com` or `.net`).

### I thought only non-profits used .org!

While that was the original intent for `.org`, it is not a requirement. Craiglist operates at `craigslist.org` and they are very much a for-profit website. Many other (if not all) major for-profit corporations own their `.org` domain: `https://facebook.org`, `https://google.org`, `https://walmart.org`.

### Well if I can't always trust the last 3 letters in a domain, what CAN I trust?

Good question. If you like thinking critically, [here's an article from Columbia University](https://library.columbia.edu/libraries/undergraduate/evaluating_web.html) on evaluating online sources. Otherwise there's plenty of videos on YouTube.

### Why did you make this?

A friend sent me a link to a `.org` website that was claiming they were giving away free solar panels to homeowners (you can read a good article about that at [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/misleading-solar-ads-spread-coronavirus-upends-door-to-door-sales-2020-5)). And now for $10 / year I can send a handy link to anyone else so I don't have to explain why `scamwebsite.org` isn't trustworthy.
